# Scripts
Just my scripting adventures

My scripts are my own adventure while i learning Linux, automating little projects, one at a time.
My goal is aimed at better out of the box quality of life.

I work mostly with Debian

  non-free.sh 

             |-> Based on https://gist.github.com/kstefanini/b22c9775fb19fc41c8f3
             
             |-> Edits source.list based on debian http redirector
             
             |-> Adds main, contrib, non-free Repos
             
             |-> Adds Backports

  sudoers.sh  

             |-> Copys the session username
             
             |-> Installs sudo
             
             |-> Adds current username with sudo permissions

  webmin.sh

             |-> Adds webmin.list to source.list.d
             
             |-> Installs webmin
